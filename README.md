The repository includes a markdown document, "Methods_process.Rmd" which outlines the steps taken to analyse the Tn-seq files

The python scripts used in the methods are found in 'scripts' directory.

R code for making the plots in the paper are in 'plot_code', and the lists of genes used are in 'gene_lists' directory.

An R data object with a dataframe including all the resampling data from all of the cattle samples is included as 'resamp_data.RData'

Insertion files in .wig for each sample are found in 'insertion_files' directory.

Data_files includes: prot tables, reference sequences, list of TA sites per gene, and the list of genes with zero insertions
